# There are two types of processes:
#   service: requires port
#   worker (service: false): only starts up

# each process follows InitProcessConfig
# mandatory: name, executor, file
# all path arguments (env-files, file argument, log)
#   should be set up relatively to this file or have absolute path
processes:
  - name: service_0         # this name will be used to identify process through cubectl cli command interface

    executor: python        # can be empty string
    file: tests/assets/example_services/example_service_0.py
    arguments:
      '--name': name_0      # redirects ('>') and pipes ('|') will not work

    environment:            # object of env variables (overrides vars from files)
      FOO: 'BAR'
      ONE: 'ONE1'
    env_files: []           # list of env files
    dotenv: false           # if true (default true) tries to load .env file near command file

    service: true           # if true (default false) assigns port and nginx config
    port: 1234              # used only for creating nginx config
    log: log0.log           # file from which logs are going to be read
